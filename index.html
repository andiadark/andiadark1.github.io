                    to her family, and she is the eldest of 4 girls. She enjoys going to the gym 
                    often to decompress and to gain strength. Also, as of January 1st, 2020, she 
                    has been practicing a vegan way of life to lessen her carbon footprint and reduce 
                    animal suffering because of animal agriculture. In the future, she hopes to 
                    open a vegan restaurant featuring some of her families' favorite recipes.

                    <h3>College Journey:</h3>

                    <h3>Why Computer Science?</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: large">
                    &nbsp She loves problem-solving, probably a little too much. Andia is the type of person to keep trying to solve a problem until it's solved.
 Programming keeps you on your toes. Programming itself is not that hard, but finding efficient solutions to problems can be a challenge, but that is what makes it fun!
